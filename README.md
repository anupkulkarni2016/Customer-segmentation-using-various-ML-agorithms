**Project Overview**
This project develops a BERT-based sentiment analysis model to classify Amazon product reviews and segment customers based on sentiment-driven insights. The model enhances traditional sentiment analysis with feature extraction and clustering techniques to provide businesses with actionable consumer insights.

**Key Features**
Sentiment Classification: Uses BERT to analyze customer sentiment (positive/negative).
Feature Extraction: Identifies keyword frequencies, sentiment scores, and review patterns.
Customer Segmentation: Implements K-Means clustering for targeted marketing.
Data Preprocessing: Includes tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and lemmatization.
Evaluation Metrics: Measures model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Tech Stack**
Python, PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers
BERT-based Sentiment Analysis
K-Means Clustering for Segmentation
Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib for Data Processing & Visualization
